### Documentation for the Code

This Python code leverages LangChain and Ollama for document processing and question answering. It involves loading a PDF document, splitting it into chunks, creating embeddings using a pre-trained model, storing them in a vector store, and finally using an AI model to answer a query based on the document content. Below is a detailed explanation of the code components:

---

### **Imports**

```python
from ra_fs import *
from langchain.llms import Ollama
from langchain import PromptTemplate
```

- `ra_fs`: A custom module (possibly part of your local environment) containing utility functions for handling file system operations (such as loading PDF documents, splitting them, and creating embeddings).
- `langchain.llms.Ollama`: LangChain’s integration for working with Ollama models. Ollama is a platform that offers various language models for tasks such as question answering, summarization, etc.
- `langchain.PromptTemplate`: A LangChain class used to create and manage prompt templates, allowing for the efficient generation of dynamic prompts for different queries.

---

### **Loading the Ollama Model**

```python
llm = Ollama(model="phi3", temperature=0)
```

- **Purpose**: This line loads a specific model (named `phi3`) from Ollama for language modeling tasks.
- **Parameters**:
  - `model="phi3"`: Specifies the model to use. In this case, `phi3` is a pre-trained model available on Ollama.
  - `temperature=0`: This controls the randomness of the model's output. A temperature of `0` ensures deterministic (non-random) results, meaning the model will always produce the same output for the same input.

---

### **Loading the Embedding Model**

```python
embed = load_embedding_model(model_path="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

- **Purpose**: This line loads a pre-trained embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) using the previously defined `load_embedding_model` function.
- **Parameters**:
  - `model_path="all-MiniLM-L6-v2"`: Specifies the pre-trained model to use for creating text embeddings. This model is a smaller transformer model that generates dense vector representations for text.
- **Returns**: An embedding model object, which will be used to create vector embeddings for the documents.

---

### **Loading and Splitting the Documents**

```python
docs = load_pdf_data(file_path="C:/Users/SK/Downloads/financial_report/RFL_2022.pdf")
documents = split_docs(documents=docs)
```

- **Purpose**: These lines load and preprocess the PDF document.
- **Process**:
  - `load_pdf_data(file_path=...)`: This function loads the PDF document located at the specified file path (`RFL_2022.pdf`), using the `PyMuPDFLoader` to extract text content from the PDF.
  - `split_docs(documents=docs)`: After loading the document, it is passed to the `split_docs` function. This function splits the document into smaller chunks, making it easier to handle large documents and retrieve relevant information for question answering.
- **Returns**:
  - `docs`: The raw content of the PDF document.
  - `documents`: A list of smaller document chunks.

### **Creating the Vector Store**

```python
vectorstore = create_embeddings(documents, embed)
```

- **Purpose**: This line creates vector embeddings for each document chunk using the `create_embeddings` function.
- **Process**:
  - `create_embeddings(documents, embed)`: This function takes the document chunks and the embedding model to generate vector representations of the text. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
- **Returns**: A FAISS vector store containing the embeddings for the document chunks, which can be used for similarity-based retrieval.

---

### **Converting Vector Store to Retriever**

```python
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
```

- **Purpose**: This line converts the FAISS vector store into a retriever.
- **Process**:
  - `vectorstore.as_retriever()`: This method converts the stored embeddings in the FAISS vector store into a retriever that can be used to retrieve relevant documents based on a user query.
- **Returns**: A retriever object that can be used to query the vector store and retrieve the most relevant document chunks for a given query.

---

### **Creating the Prompt Template**

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```

- **Purpose**: This line creates a prompt template using the provided template string (`template`).
- **Process**:
  - `PromptTemplate.from_template(template)`: This method creates a `PromptTemplate` object from a predefined template. The template is designed to structure the AI assistant's responses according to specific instructions (such as summarizing or answering questions based on the provided context).
- **Returns**: A `PromptTemplate` object that can be used to generate prompts for the language model.

---

### **Creating the QA Chain**

```python
chain = load_qa_chain(retriever, llm, prompt)
```

- **Purpose**: This line creates a question-answering chain that combines the retriever, the language model, and the prompt.
- **Process**:
  - `load_qa_chain(retriever, llm, prompt)`: This function creates a `RetrievalQA` chain using the retriever (for document retrieval), the language model (`llm`) for answering questions, and the `prompt` template to guide the model’s behavior.
  - The chain allows the model to retrieve relevant documents based on the query and then generate a response based on the retrieved context.
- **Returns**: A `RetrievalQA` chain object, which can be used to answer questions based on the provided documents.

---

### **Getting the Response**

```python
get_response("generate summary Profit and loss statement of Reliance Financial Limited, 2022", chain)
```

- **Purpose**: This line queries the created QA chain to get a response for a specific question.
- **Process**:
  - `get_response(query, chain)`: This function sends the user query (`"generate summary Profit and loss statement of Reliance Financial Limited, 2022"`) to the `RetrievalQA` chain. The chain retrieves relevant documents and generates a response based on the context.
  - The response is then printed, with the text wrapped for better readability.
- **Returns**: The response generated by the language model is printed, which should be a summary of the Profit and Loss statement from the provided document.

---

### **Summary of the Workflow**

1. **Load the Document**: The code loads a PDF document (`RFL_2022.pdf`) using `load_pdf_data`.
2. **Preprocess the Document**: It splits the document into chunks using `split_docs` for easier processing.
3. **Create Embeddings**: The `create_embeddings` function generates vector embeddings for the document chunks, which are stored in a FAISS vector store.
4. **Convert to Retriever**: The vector store is converted into a retriever, which is used to find the most relevant document chunks for a given query.
5. **Setup QA Chain**: A question-answering chain is created using the retriever, a pre-trained language model (`phi3` from Ollama), and a custom prompt template.
6. **Answering the Query**: The system answers the query ("generate summary Profit and loss statement of Reliance Financial Limited, 2022") by retrieving relevant document chunks and generating a summary using the LLM.

### **Conclusion**

This code demonstrates how to build an AI-powered document processing and question-answering system. By leveraging LangChain's document processing capabilities (embedding models, vector stores, and retrievers), combined with Ollama's LLM, the system can answer complex questions by referring to the context within documents.
